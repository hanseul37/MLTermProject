Individuals preparing for employment often find it challenging to determine whether their qualifications and portfolios are suitable for a particular company. 
Additionally, with numerous job postings available, some may struggle to identify opportunities that align with their skills. 
To address this, we aimed to create a system that collects information from company job postings, such as majors and fields, and integrates data from reviews by individuals who have worked at these companies. 
By utilizing user portfolios, career history, preferences, and other factors, the system recommends job postings that are suitable for the user. 
Our goal is to develop a practical system, and to achieve this, we trained the model using actual employment data from Korea.
